# radioday
A small utility returning the radio propagation state ("day", "night", "gray") for any location, date, and time.

Intended use:

```cp radio-config-`./radioday jo65mr`.cfg radio-config.cfg```

with three time-specific files: `radio-config-day.cfg`, `radio-config-night.cfg`, and `radio-config-gray.cfg`.
